"Project Jumpius" - a game for LD33 about jumping in city and fighting against humanity

I made this game for Ludum Dare 33, Compo category
Theme : "You are the monster"

I was afraid of making something ambitious. So I decided to make a simple game, but polish it as much as I can in 48 hours.

Controls : 
    click and hold LMB to increase a jumping force
    release LMB to make a jump
    while sitting on something - click RMB to throw it
    you need a blood from humanity to increase health and make big jumps

Target : survive as long as possible

If you have any questions - check out contact information on my website or just e-mail me.
Have fun!
